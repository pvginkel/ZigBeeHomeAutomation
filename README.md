This library was heavily based on many other ZigBee libraries found on the Internet, but especially on https://github.com/penner42/xbee-zha-arduino.

The clusters generated into the Clusters.h file uses a metadata definition in [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/blob/master/src/zcl/definition/cluster.ts).
